Feature: As a librarian, I want to know the genre of books are being borrowed the most
  Scenario: verify the common book genre thatâ€™s being borrowed
    When I execute a query to find the most popular book genre
    Then verify that "Classic" is the most popular book genre.

  #Note: Since the most popular genre is dynamic this
  #feature can be updated based on the data or URL.


  #select bc.name,count(*) from book_borrow bb
  #inner  join books b on bb.book_id = b.id
  #inner join book_categories bc on b.book_category_id=bc.id
  #group by name order by 2 desc;
